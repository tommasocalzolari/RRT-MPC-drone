## About

This repository contains a complete path planning pipeline for group 34 of the RO47005 'Planning and Dicision Making' course project. The objective of the project is to autonomously navigate a quadrotor from a start location (A) to a goal location (B) in a three-dimensional environment containing static obstacles, by computing and tracking a collision-free trajectory. See figure 1 for a demo:

</p>


 This repository extends and builds upon the forked repository `gym_pybullet_drones` which includes the base of the environent and quadrotor dynamics. Furthermore, for the objective stated above, the incremental sampling-based method Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (`RRT.py`, figure 2) will be used for global path planning, since it performs well in high-dimensional configuration spaces and provides asymptotic optimality and probabilistic completeness as the number of iterations approaches infinity, meaning that the probability of finding a feasible path approaches one if such a path exists, and that the cost of the solution converges to the optimal solution over time. However, for this project, a variant of RRT* has been used to speed up the path planning process by returning the first feasible path found. By doing this, as the number of iterations approaches infinity, the probability of finding a feasible path still approaches one if such a path exists but, the cost of the solution does not converge to the optimal solution over time since it does not update the path after finding the first feasible solution. In addition, Model Predictive Control (`MPC.py`, figure 2) will be used for local path planning, as it enables to avoid encountered obstacles during flight. MPC plans over a finite prediction horizon, explicitly handles constraints, and recomputes the control inputs at each time step based on updated state information, meaning that it is perfectly suited for the objective.

 The environment of py-bullet-drones has been extended by placing obstacles which the quadrotor has to avoid in `env.py`. Finally, to combine the methods in a complete pipeline, `main.py` has been developed.

## Installation 

To install the repository, including `gym_pybullet_drones` and the path planning files, find a place in your directory to store and enter the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tommasocalzolari/RO47005-PDM-Project.git
cd RO47005-PDM-Project/

conda create -n drones python=3.10
conda activate drones

pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -e . # if needed, `sudo apt install build-essential` to install `gcc` and build `pybullet`
pip3 install cvxpy

# check installed packages with `conda list`, deactivate with `conda deactivate`, remove with `conda remove -n drones --all`
```

---

## Run path planning pipeline 

once everything is set up, you can run the path planning pipeline of the quadrotor by using the following command in the terminal:
```sh
conda activate drones
cd PDM_project/
python3 main.py
```

Initially, the script will attempt to find a feasible path which will navigate to the goal position without collisions and errors recarding the quadrotors dynamics. Eventually, after finding a feasible path, you should be able to see the simulation environment including the quadrotor. A red and green line have been displayed which represent the offline planned RRT* path and smoothened spline path after applying quadrotor dynamics. While tracking the offline computed RRT* path, the quadrotor will encounter randomly placed obstacles on its path which it will have to avoid by using online MPC obstacle avoidance while remaining as close as possible to the planned path. After reaching the goal, the script will output graphs which demonstrate data and actions taken by the quadrotor.

<!--
## WIP/Desired Contributions/PRs

- [ ] Multi-drone `crazyflie-firmware` SITL support
- [ ] Use SITL services with steppable simulation
- [ ] Add motor delay, advanced ESC modeling by implementing a buffer in `BaseAviary._dynamics()`
- [ ] Replace `rpy` with quaternions (and `ang_vel` with body rates) by editing `BaseAviary._updateAndStoreKinematicInformation()`, `BaseAviary._getDroneStateVector()`, and the `.computeObs()` methods of relevant subclasses

## Troubleshooting

- On Ubuntu, with an NVIDIA card, if you receive a "Failed to create and OpenGL context" message, launch `nvidia-settings` and under "PRIME Profiles" select "NVIDIA (Performance Mode)", reboot and try again.
